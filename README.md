# Sea Creatures Classification Using Pre-trained MobileNetV2 Model

## 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify images from the **"SeaDataset."** The dataset comprises labeled images of various sea creature categories. The model employs **MobileNetV2**, a pre-trained model on ImageNet, to enhance classification performance and leverage transfer learning techniques.

## 2. Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a robust image classification model that can accurately differentiate between various categories of sea creatures. Key features of the project include:

- Utilizing **MobileNetV2** for feature extraction.
- Addressing challenges such as **class imbalance** and **overfitting**.
- Employing data preprocessing, augmentation, and class weighting to ensure effective training.

This approach demonstrates the power of transfer learning, providing better alignment with the dataset characteristics and yielding insights into model optimization.
